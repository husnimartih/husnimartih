Invention history: How did some inventions become successful?
Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
1. The Telephone: This invention was actually two separate ideas – one by Alexander Graham Bell and the other by Samuel Morse. Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.

Tips for creative expression:
Creative expression is a key part of any creative person’s arsenal. Whether it’s painting, writing, filmmaking, or simply spending time outside, creativity is key to any creative process. However, there are a few tips that can help you get started on your creative journey. Here are some tips:
1. Find your voice: When you start out in the creative process, it can be difficult to find your unique voice. One way to do this is to think about what kind of art you want to create and how you want people to feel when they see it. This will help you find your artistic voice and become more confident with your work.

2. Practice: The second step in becoming more creative is practice. When you first start out, it can be hard to put your ideas into practice because they may not seem that important.

How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs. This will help you determine which problems might be best solved by creating a new product or service, or by improving an existing one.

2. Consider who your target market is.
