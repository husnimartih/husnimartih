It has since been used to clean teeth and remove plaque from teeth, and it has even been used in bariatric surgery.

One of the biggest challenges for any new idea is being rejected by those who have been familiar with your product or service before. This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
It takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to bring your idea to market. However, if you keep at it, you will eventually reach your goals.

The five types of creativity: Abstract, Imaginative, Creative, Mental, and Physical.
Creative ideas are a type of creativity that comes from different areas of the brain. The five types of creativity are abstract, imaginative, creative, mental, and physical. Abstract creativity is when an idea is without any specific details. Imagination is when an idea comes from your mind and not from reality. Creative ideas come from all different parts of the brain and can be physical or mental. Mental creativity is when you have a strong idea but do not know how to put it into words. Physical creativity comes when you come up with new ways to use old things. Finally, there is creative physicality which comes about when you create something that no one has ever thought of before.
