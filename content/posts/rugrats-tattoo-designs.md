What are some potential risks associated with innovation?
There are a variety of potential risks associated with innovation, but one of the most important is the risk that new ideas and technologies can be dangerous or harmful. For example, some think that the invention of the airplane could lead to increased danger to passengers and crews. Another concern is that innovations in technology can help our environment become increasingly worse. For example, the development of artificial intelligence could create problems such as creating robots that can think for themselves and inflict harm on nature.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.
