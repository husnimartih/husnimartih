How to do brainstroming in your business: What are some tips?
Are you struggling to keep up with the ever-growing pace of business? If so, brainstroming may be the perfect solution for you. Brainstroming is a technique used in business that helps you stay focused and organized. Here are some tips on how to do it in your own business: 
1. Set goals and targets.

When you start brainstroming, it’s important to have specific goals and targets that you want to achieve. By setting these goals, you can ensure that your brainstroming efforts are directed towards achieving these rather than just talking about it without actually doing anything. 

2. Find a way to track progress.

One of the best ways to track progress during brainstroming is by using a goal tracker such as Goalilla or MorningStar.

Idea #2: Get inspiration from other cultures or websites
Inspiration can be found in many places, including websites and cultures. If you are looking to get your ideas for new designs or products from other sources, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, take into account the tone of the website or culture you are looking to emulate. If it is lighthearted and fun, then copying that style will likely be successful. However, if the website or culture is moreserious or educational, then it is important to think about what type of ideas could be included on the site or product. Additionally, think about what type of message the site or culture wants to send. If you want to copy their style but add your own unique spin on it, make sure to do so in a way that is enticing and relevant to the target audience. Finally, always remember that inspiration comes from everywhere and not just from specific websites or cultures.

Brainstorming:
1. When it comes to brainstorming for creative ideas, there are a few key things to keep in mind.
2. First, it’s important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you hoping to achieve with your brainstorming session?

3. Once you know what you want to accomplish, it’s time to start generating ideas. There are a few different methods you can use to do this, such as free association or listing.

4. Once you have a good list of ideas, it’s time to start narrowing them down. Start by eliminating any that are clearly not viable, then move on to evaluating the remaining options.

5. Ultimately, you want to choose the best idea or ideas from your brainstorming session and develop them further.
