What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.

Creative process: How does the creative process work, and how does it differ from other forms of intelligence?
Creative process: How does it work?
There is no one answer to this question as the creative process is different for everyone. However, there are some general principles that can be followed to help create valuable and successful products or ideas. 

The creative process begins with the idea or concept. This can be anything from a question that needs to be answered to a plan of how something should be done. From here, it is up to the individual to decide whether they want to pursue the idea or not. If they do, they will need some help in order to turn it into a reality. This includes coming up with a name, designing the prototype, and making sure everything is ready for production. Once all of these steps are complete, it is finally up to the customer or user to test and give feedback before finalizing their decision.
