Idea generation: What makes some ideas more creative than others?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more creative than others, but there are some general principles that apply to all creative ideas.
One principle is that ideas should be original. Ideas that are based on other people's work or experience can be less creative because they're recycled or copied from other sources.

Another principle is that ideas should be fresh. Ideas that have been around for a while can become stale and unoriginal. Fresh ideas are always more innovative and exciting to think about.
