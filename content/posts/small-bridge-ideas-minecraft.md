The effects of innovation on society:
Innovation is a process of change in any field, let alone business. When it comes to the world of business, innovation can mean anything from the introduction of a new product to the redesign of an entire company. In this day and age, businesses must constantly be on the lookout for new ideas and solutions to their problems in order to stay afloat and make a profit.
However, while innovation can have positive effects on society as a whole, it also has its downside. The most common issue with innovation is that it can drive up Costs and decrease Profit margins. In recent years, there has been an increase in companies that are implementing innovative methods without considering the consequences first. This has resulted in increased costs for consumers and businesses alike, which has caused them to lose out on potential revenue.
