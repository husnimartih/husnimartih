Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.

The future of work: What will new technologies mean for the workforce?
New technologies will have a significant impact on the workforce in the not too distant future. They include things like artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and robotics. All of these new technologies present opportunities and challenges for the workforce. 
One important thing to note is that no one technology will be completely dominant. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

For example, AI can help improve efficiency in many industries, such as retail or factory work. However, it can also lead to unemployment if used incorrectly. 

Nanotechnology offers a number of potential solutions for improving efficiency in businesses and workplaces. However, it is still in its early stages of development and has some potential drawbacks as well. For example, nanotechnology-based clothing can't be recycled so it needs to be disposed of properly or stored away for long periods of time.
