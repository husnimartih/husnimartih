Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.

The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

Why big ideas are important
There are a number of reasons why big ideas are important. They can make ideas more likely to be implemented, they can help to lay the groundwork for new ideas, and they can help to build bridges between different parts of a company or office. Big ideas also tend to be more affordable and easier to execute than smaller ones, which can lead to increased success when trying to create change within an organization.
