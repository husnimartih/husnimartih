How does the creative process work? How does an artist come up with ideas for their artwork? What are some common techniques used in the creative process?
Creative artists use a variety of creative techniques in order to come up with new and original ideas for their artwork. Some common techniques used by creative artists are brainstorming, problem solving, and imagination. In order to get started in the creative process, artists often need some inspiration. This can come from reading articles, watching videos, or listening to music. Once they have some inspiration, the artist can start to work on creating their own ideas. Sometimes this involves coming up with different ways to depict a certain subject or idea. Once the artist has a good idea for their artwork, they need to put it into practice in order to make it as good as they can. Sometimes working on an artwork takes many different iterations before it is finally finished.
