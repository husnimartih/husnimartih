There is no one right way to approach invention
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or approach to something. There are many different ways to approach invention, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some people believe that the best way to approach invention is to come up with as many ideas as possible, and then experiment with them until you find the one that works best. Others think that it's better not to try anything at all, and instead just wait for an idea to come along that they can use in their business or product. There is no right way to approach invention, and it depends on the person working on it.
