What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?

2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.
