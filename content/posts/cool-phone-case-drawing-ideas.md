Invention ideas are always something that people come up with on their own, or when they are inspired by another person or idea. There are so many different ways to make things better, and there are so many different ways to make money. There is no one best way to think about invention ideas, and no one best way to come up with them. What matters most is what you decide to do with the ideas you come up with.
