brainstorming: How do you start brainstorming?
brainstorming is a process by which creative ideas are generated. It can be used to come up with solutions to problems, new concepts or just thinking out loud. There are different ways you can start brainstorming and it really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for ideas for your next project then the best way to start is by talking to friends, family or others who have had the same experience. If you are looking for ideas for personal projects then there are many different ways to generate them. One way is by using online tools like Google Docs or Excel. Another way is by taking a walk around your neighbourhood and seeing what people are doing that might be inspiration for your own project. The bottom line is that regardless of what method you choose, always ensure that you are working in a productive manner and that you are making sure that your ideas get put into action.
