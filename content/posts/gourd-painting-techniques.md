Safety basics for do-it-yourselfers: Every project has its own safety guidelines, so be sure to follow them carefully when planning and carrying out a DIY
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, be sure to follow safety basics when planning and carrying out projects. Here are a few tips:
1. Follow local safety guidelines: Many projects require special attention when done by yourself, such as building your own basement or installing a new roof. Cities with stricter safety regulations often have more specific safety guidelines that you must obey. Follow these rules to avoid potential injuries or worse.

2. Use common sense: When planning any project, always use common sense and take precautions before beginning. For example, don't try to fix something without first knowing how it works - this can lead to dangerous surprises down the road!

3. Get help if needed: If you need assistance with a project, don't hesitate to ask friends or family members for help. They may have experience and knowledge that you didn't consider.

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.
