The Differences between Creative Art and Reality Art: There are a few different types of creative art, but they all have one common goal â€“ to inspire.
Creative art is all about inspiring people to think differently. Reality art, on the other hand, is all about reality. They may have different goals, but they both aim to promote an accurate representation of the world around them. Here are some key differences between creative and reality art: 
1) Creative artists often use their own imagination to create pieces that are unique and inspiring. Reality artists often rely on real-world objects or events to create their work. 
2) Creative artists often use more color and light than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on shadows and reflections for their work. 
3) Creative artists often use more movement than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on stills and images to create their pieces.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation. The first is that innovation should be incremental, meaning that it shouldn't come from one big leap forward but rather incremental changes that improve upon the current system. Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.
