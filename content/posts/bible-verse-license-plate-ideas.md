The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
1. Make sure you have an EMPATHY FOR THE TOPIC YOU ARE FOCUSING ON.

Before beginning brainstroming, it is important to have an understanding of the topic you are trying to focus on. If you don’t care about the issue at hand, your mind will become clouded with distractions and it will be difficult to find the energy necessary to focus on the task at hand.

The 5 Types of Ideas: Creative, Strategic, Normative, Primal, and Vague.
Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.
