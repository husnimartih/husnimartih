Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.

What are some potential risks associated with innovation?
There are a variety of potential risks associated with innovation, but one of the most important is the risk that new ideas and technologies can be dangerous or harmful. For example, some think that the invention of the airplane could lead to increased danger to passengers and crews. Another concern is that innovations in technology can help our environment become increasingly worse. For example, the development of artificial intelligence could create problems such as creating robots that can think for themselves and inflict harm on nature.
