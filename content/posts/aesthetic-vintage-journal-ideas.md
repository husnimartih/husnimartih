Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!

Filming: How do you film your creative ideas?
Filming Creative Ideas can be a pretty enlightening experience, if done correctly. Not only do you get to see your ideas in action, but you also get to learn how to capture and film creative moments that will help you grow as a filmmaker. Here are four tips to filming creative ideas: 1. Do your research: before you start shooting, it’s important to do your research on what type of footage is going to work best for your story. What does the audience want? What are the challenges of capturing that vision successfully? These questions will help determine the filming techniques that work best for your project. 2. Get creative: not all creativity is created equal. Sometimes, filming creative ideas can be more about experimenting than taking risks.
