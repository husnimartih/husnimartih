Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is the process of creating something new, using an original idea or design. Patent and trade mark are the two most common types of invention. Patent covers a specific invention, while trade mark covers a particular name or symbol that is used by someone else. There are many different types of inventions, but these are the most common:
Patents: A patent is a document that shows that someone has invented a specific product or service. The patent can cover any kind of product or service, from a simple invention to a very complex one.

Trade marks: Trade marks are similar to patents, but they cover specific names or symbols that are used by someone else instead of just products. Trade marks can be registered with the trade mark office and they can be used on products and services.

Safety basics for do-it-yourselfers: Every project has its own safety guidelines, so be sure to follow them carefully when planning and carrying out a DIY
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, be sure to follow safety basics when planning and carrying out projects. Here are a few tips:
1. Follow local safety guidelines: Many projects require special attention when done by yourself, such as building your own basement or installing a new roof. Cities with stricter safety regulations often have more specific safety guidelines that you must obey. Follow these rules to avoid potential injuries or worse.

2. Use common sense: When planning any project, always use common sense and take precautions before beginning. For example, don't try to fix something without first knowing how it works - this can lead to dangerous surprises down the road!

3. Get help if needed: If you need assistance with a project, don't hesitate to ask friends or family members for help. They may have experience and knowledge that you didn't consider.
