What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative ideas that can change the way we live and work. From developing new transportation systems to improving food quality, there are many ways to put big ideas into practice.
One way to get started onbig ideas is by thinking about what others have done before you. When you come up with a great idea, don’t just credit yourself – give your idea a name and make it a point to share it with others. This way, you can get feedback and help others build on your idea.

Once you’ve got some good big ideas under your belt, it’s time for the hard part: coming up with ways to make them a reality.
