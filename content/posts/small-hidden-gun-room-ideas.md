There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision:

-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
