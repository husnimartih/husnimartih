How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.

How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.
