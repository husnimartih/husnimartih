The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you donâ€™t know what you want, itâ€™s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.
