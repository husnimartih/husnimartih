Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.

Creative abilities: What are they and how do they differ from other abilities?
Creative abilities can be defined in many different ways, but the most commonly accepted definition is that creativity is a quality or state of being that enables people to come up with new and innovative ideas. This ability can differ from person to person, but typically it refers to a spark of inspiration or an idea that comes to mind.
There are several different ways creative abilities can be measured, including creative thinking tests and creative writing exercises. However, the most common way to measure creativity is through art or poetry. This is because art has the ability to stir emotions and evoke feelings in people, which can then be used as a measure of creativity.

There are also several other abilities that may contribute to creativity, such as problem-solving skills, listening skills, and communication skills. However, these Abilities do not typically go hand in hand with creativity.
