Ideas are everything. They give people a way to think about problems and come up with solutions. It can be difficult to come up with ideas, but with some effort, anyone can create something new. There are many different types of ideas, but here are four that are particularly useful for business:
1. Problem-solving: When you have a problem, you need to come up with a solution. One of the best ways to do this is by thinking about the problem and coming up with ideas on how to solve it. You might come up with a plan or an idea on how to solve it, or you might just have some creative neurons firing and come up with an amazing solution!

2. Innovation: When you’re looking for new ideas, it’s important to think outside the box.
