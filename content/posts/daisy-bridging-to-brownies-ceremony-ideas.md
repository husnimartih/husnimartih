Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.

What is the young adult book industry like today?
The young adult book industry is changing rapidly, and there are a number of different ways that it is doing so. One way that the industry is changing is in terms of how books are being published. 
Before, books were published as e-books and mailed to customers. This method allowed for less editing and revision, which made the books more straightforward to read. However, this type of publishing has been gradually replaced by the electronic book format. 

The electronic book format allows for a much wider range of content to be included in a book, making it more diverse and vibrant than ever before. Additionally, this format eliminates the need for physical copies of books, which makes them more cost-effective. 

As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what new ways it comes up with to keep readers engaged and invested in its products.

The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.
