The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.

Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
There are a number of ways to go about marketing your invention idea. One option is to sell directly to companies who may be interested in manufacturing or distributing your product. Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.

Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.
