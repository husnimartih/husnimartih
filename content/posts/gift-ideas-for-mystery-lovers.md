1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible.

New ideas are always exciting, no matter how old they may be. For example, consider the idea of a "universal basic income." This would be a monthly payment to every citizen that is free of charge, regardless of their income. This would help to encourage people to work and improve the economy.
