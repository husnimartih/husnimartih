Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.
