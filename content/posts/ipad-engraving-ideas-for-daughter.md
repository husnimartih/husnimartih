The Creative Process: How do we come up with new ideas?
Creativity is a process. It's not just a matter of coming up with new ideas. The creative process goes deeper than that. It's about how we come up with new ideas, and what we do to help ourselves get there.
There are different ways to approach creativity. Some people use brainstorming or problem-solving methods to come up with new ideas. Others rely on creative visualization or brainstorming techniques known as “brainstormsing.”
