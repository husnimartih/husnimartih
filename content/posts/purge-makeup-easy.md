The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.

The different types of creativity: How does one become creative?
Creativity is a spectrum that goes from simple to complex. As we move up the spectrum, creativity becomes more abstract and difficult to define. However, all creativity comes from some form of inspiration or imagination. One way to become more creative is by practicing some form of brainstorming or problem-solving. Additionally, becoming exposed to new cultures and ideas can also help open one's eyes to new ways of thinking and creating.

Aesthetic preferences: What kind of things make someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors?
Creative endeavors can be both rewarding and challenging, but they always include some form of art. Whether it's the creation of beautiful paintings or the designing of innovative new technologies, artists are always working to improve their skills. One important aspect of artistic excellence is aesthetics, which refers to the way a person looks. There are a variety of factors that can influence an artist's appearance, and many people have different preferences when it comes to what makes someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors. Some people prefer simple, unadorned designs while others enjoy colorful and intricate pieces. Some people like their artwork to be popular and flashy while others prefer more introspective pieces that will get them noticed. However, there is no one definitive way that artists look good or bad in their work. It ultimately depends on how they approach their art and how they feel about themselves as individuals.

How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.
