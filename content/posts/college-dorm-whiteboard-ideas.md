What is innovation?
Innovation is the sudden change in a product or service, resulting from an idea that was not previously considered. It is often associated with new technology, but can also come from outside of the product or service itself. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve services and products while protecting those that use them, as well as creating value for those who invest in it.

How can you get started with creative art?
Creative art is something that anyone can do, regardless of experience or skill level. All you need is a willingness to experiment and explore, and you can create something truly unique and beautiful. Here are a few tips to get started with creative art:
1. Find your medium. Whether you prefer painting, sculpture, photography, or any other type of art, find the medium that speaks to you and start experimenting.

2. Let go of perfectionism. Creative art is about expression and experimentation, so don’t worry about making mistakes. Embrace the imperfections and see what kinds of interesting results they produce.

3. Follow your instincts. Trust your gut feeling when it comes to creating art – chances are, if you feel drawn to certain colors, materials, or subjects, there’s a reason why.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.
