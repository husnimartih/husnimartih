Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

What are some of the challenges you face when trying new ideas?
There are a number of challenges that can come about when trying new ideas. Some of these challenges may include: difficulty in getting others to embrace the idea, derailed progress because of creative differences, and confusion over what is truly important when it comes to implementing the idea. However, even if these obstacles don't seem insurmountable, they can still cause setbacks and make it difficult to see the value in pursuing an idea. It's important to remember that ideas are worth pursuing, regardless of the obstacles that may be encountered along the way. So whether you're facing difficulty adapting or disagreement over how best to use an 8-bit game as your business model, remember that ideas are worth fighting for.
