Conclusion: How to develop big ideas effectively.
Big ideas are the seeds that can turn a small idea into a big project or idea. They are the building blocks of success in any creative endeavor. By understanding how to develop big ideas effectively, you can make your projects more likely to succeed. 
To landscape a new garden, for example, it is important to understand the different types of plants and what they will grow in. To develop a plan for an office remodel, employees need to understand the different needs of each room and how best to layout them so that everyone has their space. 

 Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: making your project more likely to succeed. With practice, you can develop the ability to identify and capitalize on these opportunities.

The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.
