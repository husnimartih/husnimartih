Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
