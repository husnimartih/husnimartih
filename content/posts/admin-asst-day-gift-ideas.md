Brainstroming is a condition in which one’s thoughts and feelings are focused on a single topic. This can be beneficial for the individual, as it allows them to focus on their problem and come up with a solution. However, brainstroming can also have negative effects, depending on the person’s personality and mindset. If someone is brainstroming all the time, they may feel overwhelmed and alone. In addition, they may start to doubt themselves and their abilities.
