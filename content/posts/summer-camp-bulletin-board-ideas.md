Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

The Evolution of Invention: From the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World
Invention is the process by which humans come up with new ideas, products, or methods. Innovation has been a part of human culture for as long as humans have been able to create things. The ancient Greeks were some of the first to come up with inventions. They had a system in which they would submit new ideas to a panel of judges, and if they were found to be good, they would be printed out and given to other people. The judges would then use their judgement to decide who should get the idea and who should make it into a product.
The modern world is full of invention. We have technology that allows us to create anything we want, and we can also find ways to improve on what others have created before us. This makes innovation something very important for humanity.
