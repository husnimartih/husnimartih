Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.

Conclusion: Invention ideas are a great way to get your idea out there and see what people think of it.
As a business owner, inventor, or just someone who loves to see their ideas come to life, it can be really exciting to see what other people think of your invention. It can also help get your idea out there and see how people are reacting to it. So many times, the less you know about your invention before you make it public, the more risky it is to try and market it yourself. But with the right invention ideas, you can take advantage of all the publicity that comes with them and make sure your idea is seen by as many people as possible.
