Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.

Types of innovation: Product, process, market, and technology
Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

Process Innovation: Processes can be innovative too. For example, Google's search engine was revolutionary because it used natural language processing to find relevant results quickly.

Market Innovation: The market can also be innovative if it is different from what other companies offer. Apple's iPhone was the first phone to sell in billion units worldwide.
