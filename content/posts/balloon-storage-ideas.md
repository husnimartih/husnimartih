Definition of big ideas: What is it, and why should we care?
The definition of big ideas can vary greatly, but typically they refer to ideas that could have a significant impact on society or the world. Big ideas are usually long-term and require thought and effort to put into fruition, so they're important not just for businesses but also for government and social organizations. Here are five definitions of big ideas that may help make them more clear:
1) A big idea is an innovative solution or plan that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
2) A big idea is a new way of thinking about something that's been around for a while but hasn't been fully explored.
3) An idea with potential to create jobs, boost economy, or improve education is often called a big idea. 
4) Ideas with significant implications for individuals or groups are also considered big ideas.
