Definition of Innovation: Ideas that improve the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of life
Innovation is the process of developing a new product, service, or idea that improves quality, efficiency, or effectiveness. Innovation ideas can be specific to a certain industry or field, but they also have the potential to be applied to any area of life. 
One example of an innovation that has been implemented successfully in many industries is the automobile. The development and implementation of efficient and effective car engines has led to increased speeds and efficiency on the road. Another example is the internet. The early days were difficult for website designers because no one had a clear definition of what “web design” meant. However, as technology evolved and more people became comfortable using computers, websites started popping up all over the place. As a result, web design has become one of the most popular areas for innovation today.

Development of an invention: What steps do I need to take?
Invention ideas are something that can be created within a few hours or even less if you have some creativity and the right tools. To get started, you will need to come up with an idea for a product or service and then develop it further. There are a few key steps that you will need to take in order to create an invention:
1. Choose the right target market. This is where you will figure out what your product or service is meant for and who is the best target audience. You can do this by doing market research or by considering customer feedback.
