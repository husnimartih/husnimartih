How can we turn big ideas into real projects?
How can we turn big ideas into real projects? There are a few key strategies that can help. First, we need to identify the big idea. Once we know what it is, our next step is to develop a plan for how to make it a reality. Once we have a plan, it’s time to gather the resources necessary to make it happen. This might include money, manpower, or other resources that we can borrow from others or give away. If all of these resources are available, the next step is to put together a team of advisors who can help us achieve our goals. Finally, once we have achieved our goals and made progress towards our target date, it’s important to celebrating and measuring the success of our project in order to maintain motivation and accountability.
