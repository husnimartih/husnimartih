The benefits of creativity: How can it be used?
Creativity is a valuable tool that can be used to solve problems and create new ideas. There are many benefits to creativity, including making new friends, developing new skills, and increasing your productivity. Here are three ways creativity can be used in your life: 
1. Create original ideas: When you have an idea for a product or project, start by thinking about how you could make it better or more unique. Try to come up with a solution that nobody else has thought of before. This can be really helpful in getting started on a project or finding a solution to a problem.

2. Make connections: When you make new friends, it can be really helpful to get out and talk about your interests. It can also be fun to meet others who share the same interests as you do. This will help you develop relationships that are beneficial both professionally and personally.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
