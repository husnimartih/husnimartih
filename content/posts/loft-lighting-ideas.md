What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

Definition of innovation: How can it be used in business?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service or idea that is different from the existing ones. Innovation can be used in business in different ways and can be seen as a way to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue and create new opportunities for businesses. There are many different types of innovation, but three main types are product innovation, service innovation and market niche innovation. Product Innovation: Product innovation occurs when a company creates a new product that better meets the needs of their customers. This can involve developing a new type of product, designing an innovative marketing strategy or even coming up with a unique idea for a product. Service Innovation: Service innovation occurs when companies create new services that meet the needs of their customers better than those currently available. This could involve creating innovative delivery methods or providing unique services that don't exist elsewhere.
