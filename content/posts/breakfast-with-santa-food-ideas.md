Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Invention is the birth of a new idea or method. Sometimes this is something as simple as coming up with a new way to do something, but sometimes it's more complex. For example, after centuries of working on Alchemy, scientists finally came up with a way to make gold in the 1500s. This was an invention, and it helped change the world.

1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.

The need for innovation
In the business world, the one thing that is always constant is change. In order to stay ahead of the competition, businesses need to be constantly innovating. They need to be looking for new ways to do things, new products to sell, and new services to offer.
Innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas, it’s about implementing those ideas and making them a reality. It’s about taking risks and being willing to fail. It’s about being able to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.

If businesses want to stay relevant and competitive, they need to embrace innovation. It’s no longer an option, it’s a necessity.
