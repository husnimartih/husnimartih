How will you make sure that your content is useful and engaging?
The content of an article should be useful, engaging and interesting to the reader. It should also be clear, concise and easy to read. Here are 8 tips for making sure that your content is useful, engaging and interesting:
1. Take into account the audience you are addressing. What are the interests of your audience? Are they business owners, consumers or both? When writing for a specific audience, make sure to consider what information will be most effective for them.

2. Use clear language and images to help explain your ideas. People understand words more when they can see them clearly. Try using images throughout your article so that readers can visualize the concepts being discussed.

3. Use originality and creativity when creating new ideas. Don’t plagiarize other people’s work – it won’t make your content any better or more engaging.

Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.
