Conclusion: Some potential ideas that could be implemented in order to improve the current system.
One potential idea that could be implemented in order to improve the current system is an overhaul of the job listings process. This could be done through a crackdown on fake job postings, as well as more stringent verification processes for candidates. Another idea would be to change the way qualifications are assessed. currently, many jobs are filled with people with just a high school diploma or less. This could be changed so that only those who have had at least some college education are considered for a job, and those with higher qualifications are given a more chance to apply. Finally, there is the question of how to make sure that employees are happy and productive. Currently, many employees feel forced to work long hours for little pay, and sometimes donâ€™t have enough opportunities for socialization.

Commercialization: When should you commercialize an invention?
When should you commercialize an invention? 
There are a few key factors to consider when deciding when to commercialize an invention. First, commercialization can help increase the chances of success for an idea, and it can also provide financial benefits for the inventor and their company. Additionally, commercialization can help protect the intellectual property of those who have developed the invention, as well as make it easier for others to replicate and improve on the idea.
