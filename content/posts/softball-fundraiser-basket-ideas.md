The Invention Process: How does someone come up with an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with an idea for a product or service. It can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way is through brainstorming. With brainstorming, you and your team come up with ideas for products or services without anythingPre-existing knowledge or designs on your part. This allows you to come up with new ideas that might not have been thought of before. Inventors usually use this process to come up with new technology, business models, or even new ways of doing things.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
