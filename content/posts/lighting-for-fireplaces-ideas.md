How do you get started with ideas?
Start with a brainstorm. A brainstorm is a process of generating new ideas. It can be used to come up with concepts, products, services, or anything you want to think about. Sometimes you need just a few ideas to get started, and others times you need many different ones to come up with something great. The best way to find out if you need more than one idea is to do some brainstorming yourself.

The purpose of creativity: What does it achieve?
Creativity has been variously defined as the ability to think out of the box, come up with new ideas, or express yourself in a new way. In some cases creativity is simply a tool that can be used to achieve a desired outcome. However, there is another purpose for creativity – the art of creative expression. This type of creativity is often overlooked but can have a significant impact on people and businesses.
