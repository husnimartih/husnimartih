Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
