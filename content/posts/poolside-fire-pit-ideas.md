The formation of ideas
When it comes to the formation of ideas, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be aware of your own biases and assumptions. We all have them, and they can distort the way we see the world and the ideas we come up with.
It’s also important to be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. When you’re stuck in your own bubble, it’s easy to get tunnel vision and miss out on good ideas. But if you’re willing to step outside of your comfort zone and listen to other people, you might just be surprised by what you come up with.

Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment. Trying new things is how we learn and grow, so don’t be afraid to take risks.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.
