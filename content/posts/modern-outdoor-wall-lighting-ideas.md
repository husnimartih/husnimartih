Discussing the definition of invention
Invention is a process of coming up with a new product or idea. This can be done through creative thinking, designing, or even just seeing an opportunity in the market and going for it. What makes something an invention? There are many different definitions out there, but the most common one is that it is a new idea that has not been tried before. So, if you come up with a new product or idea and you do not have any prior experience with it, you are considered an inventor.
