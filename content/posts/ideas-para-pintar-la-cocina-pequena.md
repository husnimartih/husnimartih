What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.

The challenges of reaching our goals: How can we overcome roadblocks?
There are many challenges we face when looking to achieve our goals, but overcoming them is key to success. Here are a few examples:
First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations. If we set ourselves unrealistic goals, we will be less likely to achieve them. We should also be honest with ourselves about what we want and what our limitations are. This will help us identify any roadblocks that may stand in our way.

The second challenge is breaking the habit of procrastination. This can be difficult as it is an acquired taste, but having a regular plan and sticking to it will help us stay on track. However, if we don’t have enough motivation or if the situation feels too hard, it can be tough to keep going.

Thirdly, it is important to be consistent with our efforts.
