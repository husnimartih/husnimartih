What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? Brainstroming is a phenomenon that occurs when people are2006

The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea. The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future. Brainstroming can be defined in many ways, but its most common definition would say that individuals are struggling to focus on one thing and unable to complete any other tasks. This can lead to an overall feeling of overwhelm or stress. It's important to note that not all people experience brainstroming at different times or in different ways.

What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1) Define your problem: Your ideal customer won't always be available or willing to do business with you, so define your target market first.

Big ideas are the seeds of change that can grow into something more. They come from a variety of sources, including thinking outside the box, being curious, and coming up with new ways to do things. Sometimes, just thinking about an idea can spark something new in the mind. This is what happened to me when I was looking for a new way to measure air quality in my city.
