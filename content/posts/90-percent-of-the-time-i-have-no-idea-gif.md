It can also come from within an organization, as employees come up with new ideas for improving their work or creating new products.

The Importance of Innovation
Innovation is important for several reasons. First, without innovation businesses would become stagnant and eventually fail. To stay competitive, businesses must be constantly moving forward and improving upon their current offerings. Additionally, innovation can lead to new and improved products and services that customers will demand. Finally, innovation can help businesses to cut costs and improve efficiency.
In order to be successful, businesses must embrace innovation. Those that donâ€™t will likely find themselves struggling to keep up with their competitors. Those that do will be well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities and continue growing.
