coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.

Creativity is a fluid state, and it takes time to get comfortable with new ideas. Sometimes the best way to start thinking of new possibilities is by asking yourself a question.

The challenges of reaching our goals: How can we overcome roadblocks?
There are many challenges we face when looking to achieve our goals, but overcoming them is key to success. Here are a few examples:
First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations. If we set ourselves unrealistic goals, we will be less likely to achieve them. We should also be honest with ourselves about what we want and what our limitations are. This will help us identify any roadblocks that may stand in our way.

The second challenge is breaking the habit of procrastination. This can be difficult as it is an acquired taste, but having a regular plan and sticking to it will help us stay on track. However, if we don’t have enough motivation or if the situation feels too hard, it can be tough to keep going.

Thirdly, it is important to be consistent with our efforts.
