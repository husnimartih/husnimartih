Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.

Another obstacle that can impede innovation is a fear of change. This may be due to a reluctance to embrace new technologies or a fear that change will lead to disruptions in the business.

The benefits of brainstroming: Increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership.
A recent study by the University of Utah found that brainstroming – the practice of generating new ideas and solutions while under stress – can lead to increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership. Participants in the study were given a series of challenges to work on during a set time frame, then were asked to produce ideas for a new product or service. The results showed that those who did brainstroming fared better in terms of creativity, productivity, and thought leadership than those who didn’t.
The benefits of brainstroming are clear: It can help you generate more ideas and solutions, which can result in improved productivity and overall thinking skills. Whether you’re looking to boosting your business acumen or simply sparking new thinking ideas, brainstroming is an essential tool for success.
