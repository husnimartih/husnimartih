One way to do this is by increasing funding for public schools and getting rid of charters. Another idea would be increasing the number of Pell Grants so that more students can afford to attend college.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

What are some invention ideas?
1. Invention ideas are always in flux, and since new technologies keep popping up, it’s hard to come up with anything that’s truly original. However, there are a few things that you can try and base your inventions off of. One idea is to take an old technology and make it more user-friendly. Another idea is to come up with a new way of doing something that has been done before but not in the same way. Finally, you can simply come up with an idea that you have never thought of before and see if anyone else has had the same idea.
