How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?
