What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation. The first is that innovation should be incremental, meaning that it shouldn't come from one big leap forward but rather incremental changes that improve upon the current system. Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.

Benefits and challenges of innovation
Innovation is a dynamic process that can have both positive and negative consequences. Some of the benefits of innovation include increased productivity, reduced costs, and new products and services that are more efficient or effective. However, as with any dynamic process, there are also challenges associated with innovation that can lead to decreased success or even failure. These challenges can originate from the novelty of the invention itself, from the implementation of the invention into a business environment, or from the interactions between employees and customers who may be using the invention.

Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!

What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.

How can you use brainstroming to your advantage?
The power of brainstroming is clear. By using the right tools, you can use your brain to make decisions that will benefit you and your business. Brainstroming can help you focus on what’s important, gain insights into complex problems, and create better strategies. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Get a clear understanding of what you want from a problem or opportunity. This will help you identify the most important aspects of the problem or opportunity. 

2. Use brainstorms as a tool for brainstorming solutions and for exploring potential solutions to problems. 

3. Choose wisely which ideas to share with others in a brainstorming session – some ideas may be more important than others. Brainstorming is an open-ended process, so it’s best not to limit yourself too much.
