Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.

Conclusion: the importance of creative art in our lives
It is safe to say that creative art is important in our lives. After all, it is one of the few things that can truly make us feel alive. It can inspire us, move us, and even change us.
Think about the last time you were moved by a piece of art. Maybe it was a painting, a song, or even a film. Whatever it was, it likely had a profound effect on you. That’s because creative art has the power to touch our souls in a way that nothing else can.

It’s also important to remember that creative art is not just about entertainment. It can also be used as a powerful tool for self-expression and healing. For many people, art is a way to deal with difficult emotions and experiences. It can be a way to process trauma, express anger, and even find forgiveness.
