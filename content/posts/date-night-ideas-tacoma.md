Brainstroming is a technique used in the mental health field to help people focus and organize their thoughts. The term was first introduced in the 1970s by psychiatrist Melvin Konner and his colleague Joseph Goldstein, who developed the cognitive therapeutic intervention called self-actualization. Brainstroming is also known as meditative meditation, focus meditation, or mindfulness meditation.
