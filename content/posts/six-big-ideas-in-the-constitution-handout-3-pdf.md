What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.

The Different Types of Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:
1. The brainstorming idea: This is the idea that you come up with without anything specific in mind. It's just a thought or an idea that pops into your head.

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.

The impact of invention on society
Invention can have a devastating impact on society. For example, a new invention could lead to the development of a new type of cancer, or improve the way we treat diseases. Invention also has the potential to create new industries and jobs. However, there are also positive aspects to innovation. For example, advances in technology can help us get closer to our goals, or improve our lives in some way.

Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can lead to new and innovative solutions to problems. They can be generated during brainstorming sessions, when people are brainstorming for ideas for a project, or when people are coming up with new ideas for products or services. Big ideas can come from anywhere, and they can be small or large. The key is to keep them focused and to consider what could be done with them.
