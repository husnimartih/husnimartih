The different types of Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is a process of creating a new product or service from scratch. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Below are three examples of invention:
1) A new type of transportation: A car is an invention, because it has been around for centuries. 
2) A new type of food: We have invented grains and potatoes, so there is no one food that can be called "rice" or "potatoes." 
3) A new way to grow plants: We've invented peas and carrots, so there's no need for planting seeds in the ground all year round.

Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.
