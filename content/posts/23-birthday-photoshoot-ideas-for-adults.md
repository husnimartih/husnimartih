Idea 2: Reflect on your favorite memories
What are your favorite memories? What makes them so special? What do they make you feel on a deep level? These are all good questions to ask yourself, and the answers will help you shape your ideas into something truly unique. Here are a few examples: 
1. One of my favorite memories is of when I was a little girl and my family went on an overnight camping trip. It was such an amazing experience to be with my parents and see the country in all its glory. It still makes me emotional to think about it now. 
2. Another great memory from childhood is going skating with my friends in our local park. skating on winter days was one of the best things ever! Even though it's been years since that experience, I can still feel the excitement and happiness that came along with it.

How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs. This will help you determine which problems might be best solved by creating a new product or service, or by improving an existing one.

2. Consider who your target market is.
