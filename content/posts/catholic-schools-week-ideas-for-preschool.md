3.1 What are some potential steps we can take to get started on finding a solution to our problem?
The problem we are trying to solve can seem daunting and difficult, but with some creativity and effort, it is possible to find a solution. There are a number of steps that can be taken in order to get started on finding a solution, and these steps will vary depending on the problem at hand. Some possible steps include: 
1.starting with an idea – when there is no clear solution as to what the problem may be, it is often best to start by brainstorming potential solutions. This can involve thinking about what could go wrong or how something could be improved, and from this, you may be able to come up with ideas for fixing the issue. 
2.finding collaborators – once you have some ideas for fixes or solutions, it is important to find collaborators who are familiar with the subject matter or who might have other ideas that would work better.

Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.
