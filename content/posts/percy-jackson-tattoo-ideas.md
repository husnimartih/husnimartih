What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1) Define your problem: Your ideal customer won't always be available or willing to do business with you, so define your target market first.

What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Pusk√°s in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.
