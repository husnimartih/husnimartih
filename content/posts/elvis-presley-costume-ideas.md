The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation.

The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.

There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application.

There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original.
