The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.

New Directions: What options do these new ideas offer?
A new approach to mental health— called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)—offers hope for a brighter future for those struggling with depression and other mental health conditions.
MBSR is a mindfulness-based stress reduction program that was created in the 1990s by Dr. Richard Davidson and Dr. Peter Salovey. It has since been used in clinical settings to help reduce stress and improve mental health, including reducing depression symptoms.

The program is based on the idea that when people are able to be present with their thoughts, feelings, and environment, they can better manage their own emotions and relationships. MBSR is also known for its ability to improve physical health by increasing overall well-being and decreasing stress levels.
