They can work on whatever they want, and no one else is interfering or checking them out. This can be a great way to come up with unique and innovative ideas. 3.

What is big ideas and what are they good for?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. If left unchecked, big ideas can lead to important innovations that may solve world problems or improve society as a whole. However, before any big idea can be successful, it must be properly vetted and tested. This process involves understanding what is big and what is not. When done correctly, these tests can help determine if the idea is safe and viable for implementation.
