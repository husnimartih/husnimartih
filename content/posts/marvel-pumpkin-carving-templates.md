History of Invention: How has invention evolved?
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have existed. Evolution has played a role in shaping the way that Invention works, and how it is used. Invention has come in many forms, from simple methods to complex products. 
Some of the most important inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and the refrigerator. Each of these devices had a large impact on society and individual lives. The wheel was an important invention because it allowed people to move around more easily and build roads and bridges. The telephone was an important invention because it allowed people to communicate with each other without having to leave their homes or go to a library. The refrigerator was an important invention because it allowed people to store food without having to go into the kitchen. 

The importance of Invention cannot be understated.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
