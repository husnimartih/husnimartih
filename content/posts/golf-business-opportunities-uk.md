How to Pitch an Idea: Tips for successful pitches
Ideas are a powerful tool for selling and developing products. If you can come up with good ones, your pitch will be more successful. Here are some tips for creating an idea pitch that will be successful:
1. Start by identifying what your product or service does that others don't. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the problem someone else is trying to solve.
2. Find a analogy or metaphor that resonates with your target audience and helps explain how your product or service would solve that problem.
3. Be clear and concise when describing what your product or service does and how it would benefit customers. Your target audience will appreciate clarity in their purchase decision-making process.
4. Demonstrate why people should buy your product or service instead of those of your competitors.

How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

How to come up with big ideas
If you're looking for big ideas, the best way to come up with them is by brainstorming. It's an effective way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ways to think about problems or possibilities. If you're not sure how to do this, here are some tips:
1. Start by thinking about what you know. What are some of the things that have bedeviled you in the past? What have been some of your biggest challenges? Once you've gathered these information, it's time to start brainstorming potential solutions.
