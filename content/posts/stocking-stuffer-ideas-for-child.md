In order to be creative, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to create. If you don't know what it is that you're trying to create, it's hard to get started. Sometimes creativity can come from just taking ideas and turning them into something real. Sometimes all you need is a good starting point, and then you can start creating things from there.

Results and Feedback: How does your project turn out?
I’m about to head out on a camping trip with my family, and I wanted to know what type of tents and sleeping bags are the best for the trip. I found a few different options, but couldn’t decide which one would be best for us. After some research, I came up with this list of the best tents and sleeping bags for camping trips:
1) national Geographic Hexagon Sleeping Bag - This bag is perfect if you're looking for a comfortable and spacious tent. It has an interior profile that makes it easy to find a place to sleep while on your trip. Plus, it comes in black or green!

2) Osprey Tents - These tents are perfect if you're looking for a heavyweight tent that can withstand any weather conditions. They come in both children's and adult sizes and have plenty of hanging space inside.
