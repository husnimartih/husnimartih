The inventor's journey: From the inspiration to the innovation.
Invention is a process of creating something new, whether it's a product or a service. It can be an idea that someone has for years, or something that they just come up with on the spot. When someone comes up with an invention, there are several steps that they go through in order to make it into a reality. The inventor needs to come up with a concept, create a prototype, and test the product or service before they release it to the public. There are also various other steps that need to be taken in order to bring an invention to market, such as marketing and protection. With such a long journey ahead of them, there are many innovators out there who are working hard in order to make their ideas into reality.

Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what’s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.

The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.
