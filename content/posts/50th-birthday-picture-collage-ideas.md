Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

creating a plan: What are some steps you need to take in order to create a successful idea?
Creative ideas can be a huge asset to any business. However, they can also be extremely difficult to come by. In order to create a successful idea, you need to take some key steps. Here are some tips: 1. Brainstorming- It’s important to have an idea for something before starting the brainstorming process. This will help you come up with a great plan and ideas for what to pursue. 2. Diversification- If your idea is focused only on one market or industry, it will likely not be successful. You need to have at least two different ideas in mind before starting the development process. 3. Innovation- Another key factor in creating a successful idea is innovation.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.
