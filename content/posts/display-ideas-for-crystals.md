Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.

Materials: What do you need to get started?
When it comes to do-it-yourself projects, the options are endless. But before you get started on your next project, it's important to make sure you have the right materials. Here's a list of what you'll need to get started:
1. A good quality adhesive. This will be your best friend when it comes to DIY projects. Make sure to get one that will work well with the material you're using.

2. A variety of tools. Depending on the project you're working on, you'll need different tools. Some basic ones to have on hand are a hammer, screwdriver, drill, and saw.

3. The right kind of paint. Again, this will depend on the project you're working on. Make sure to get paint that is durable and will look good once it's applied.
