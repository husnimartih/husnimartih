What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.

The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

One thing that is different about the new ideas is that they often focus on solving problems instead of creating them. This makes them better at solving problems that have already been solved before, rather than creating new ones from scratch. 

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.

It's been said that ideas are like pails of water - you fill them up with as many different thoughts and concepts as you can, and then see where they take you. That's what happens when you have a great idea. You start thinking about ways to make it a reality, and then the possibilities start opening up. There's no one answer to whether or not an idea is successful, but it's always worth trying out different approaches to see what works best for you.
