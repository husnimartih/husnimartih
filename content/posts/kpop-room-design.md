3.1 What are some potential steps we can take to get started on finding a solution to our problem?
The problem we are trying to solve can seem daunting and difficult, but with some creativity and effort, it is possible to find a solution. There are a number of steps that can be taken in order to get started on finding a solution, and these steps will vary depending on the problem at hand. Some possible steps include: 
1.starting with an idea – when there is no clear solution as to what the problem may be, it is often best to start by brainstorming potential solutions. This can involve thinking about what could go wrong or how something could be improved, and from this, you may be able to come up with ideas for fixing the issue. 
2.finding collaborators – once you have some ideas for fixes or solutions, it is important to find collaborators who are familiar with the subject matter or who might have other ideas that would work better.

Conclusion: The value of big thinking
In a world that is constantly changing, it is more important than ever to be able to think big. Big ideas are what drive progress and innovation. They are the engine of the global economy.
The ability to think big is not something that everyone is born with. It is a skill that must be learned and developed. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most effective is to read widely and to expose yourself to new and different ideas.

Don't be afraid to dream big. The biggest ideas often start out as nothing more than a pipe dream. But if you have the courage to pursue them, they can change the world.
