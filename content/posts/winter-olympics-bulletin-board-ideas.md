What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone – even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.

Creativity is a term that has been around for centuries and means different things to different people. In its broadest sense, creativity refers to the ability of people to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can also refer to the state of mind in which an individual is in when they are creative. The definition of creativity also varies from person to person, so it’s important to define what creativity actually means for us all. It could mean different things depending on our individual backgrounds, experiences, and goals.
