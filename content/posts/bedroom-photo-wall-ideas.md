Idea 3: How do we use ideas?
Ideas can be put to use in many ways, but one of the most common is turning them into action plans. Whether you're looking to start a business, improve your fitness routine, or just think of new ways to spend your free time, ideas are a great way to get started. Here are three simple tips on how to use ideas to create ACTION plans:

2. Take some time for yourself and come up with 10-15 different ideas for things you could do in your spare time. Once you've narrowed it down, take a look at Action Items and see what devices or activities work best for each one.

Section 1: Defining "Diy".
Diy, or "Do It Yourself" is a popular term that refers to the process of completing a task without the help of an outside professional. Diy projects can range from simple tasks like painting a room to more complex endeavors like building a deck. No matter what the project is, there are several key things to keep in mind when embarking on a Diy journey.
The first thing to consider is whether or not you have the time and patience to complete the project. Diy projects often take longer than expected and can be frustrating if you're not prepared for setbacks. It's important to set realistic expectations and give yourself plenty of time to finish the project.

Another thing to keep in mind is your skill level. Not all Diy projects are created equal. Some require more skills and knowledge than others.
