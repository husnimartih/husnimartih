Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.

The Importance of Ideas: What makes them so important?
Ideas are what make up the foundation of any organization. They can be wrapped up in a few words, or they can be something larger that needs to be planned and executed in a complete way. Ideas need to be carefully considering before being implanted into an organization, as well as being developed for the long term. Without ideas, there would be no progress made in any business venture, regardless of its size or complexity.
