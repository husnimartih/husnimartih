The power of creativity:
Creativity is an important part of any business. It can help businesses make money, learn new things, create products or services that are unique and better than the competition, and more. However, too much creativity can be dangerous. In some cases, it can be a lead to innovation that can improve the company’s bottom line or even create new opportunities for growth. In other cases, it can lead to over-zealous ideas and a lack of critical thinking skills. To avoid these dangers, businesses need to take steps to limit their creativity and ensure that their ideas are sound before they begin implementation.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.
