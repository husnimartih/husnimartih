What are your goals?
When it comes to goal setting, there are a few different things to consider. Whether you haveSpecific goals or general ones, the following are helpful tips:
1. Set specific deadlines: This is one of the most important things to remember when goal setting. If you don’t have a deadline, it will be much harder to get started on your goal. A good way to set a deadline is by saying that you want a certain outcome by a certain date (e.g., “I want my raise in two months”).

2. Create measurable goals: By using measurable goals, you can track and measure how well your goal is coming along. This helps you identify areas that need improvement and makes setting larger goals more manageable.
