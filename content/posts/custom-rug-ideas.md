The history of invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has always been a part of history. However, the way it has changed over time can be told by looking at some of the most famous inventions. Here are 8 examples:
1. The printing press: Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, this device allowed for the publication of books by creating a new form of communication.
2. antibiotics: It was thanks to Alexander Fleming that we were able to treat infections with antibiotics in the 1940s.
3. jet engines: The Wright brothers first developed jet planes in 1903, and they were eventually able to build them into successful machines.
4. LED lights: LED lights were first invented by Charles Babbage in 1876, and they soon became popular for use in televisions and other devices.
