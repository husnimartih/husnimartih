Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.
