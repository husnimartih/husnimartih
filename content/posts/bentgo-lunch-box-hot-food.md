How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.

Definition of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of creative expression?
Creativity has been defined in many ways over time, but there is one common thread that runs through all of them: creativity is a process. In order to be creative, you have to be open to change and new ideas. This opens up the door for all sorts of possibilities, from the simple to the complex.
