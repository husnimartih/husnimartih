The science of creativity: what makes an idea creative?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas. It is a skill that can be learned and developed. There are several factors that contribute to creativity.
One of the most important factors is motivation. A creative person is usually motivated by a problem or challenge. They are not afraid of failure and are willing to take risks. They are also open to new ideas and willing to experiment.

Another important factor is knowledge. A creative person has a deep understanding of their field and is able to see things from different perspectives. They are also able to make connections between disparate ideas.

Lastly, creativity requires a certain mindset. A creative person is usually open-minded, flexible, and receptive to change. They are also able to think outside the box and see things in new ways.
