The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences.

The power of big ideas
In a world that is constantly changing and evolving, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas have the power to change the world, and they often start with just one person.
If you have an idea that you think could make a difference, don’t be afraid to share it with others. You never know who might be inspired by your idea and help turn it into a reality.

Some of the most influential people in history have been those who had big ideas. So don’t let anyone tell you that your idea is too small or too crazy – it just might be exactly what the world needs.
