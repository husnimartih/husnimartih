Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are better than those currently available. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think of it is as the change in direction of a product or service over time. Innovation can come from a company owner who decides to bring a new idea to market, as well as from employees who come up with new ways to do things that improve productivity or customer satisfaction.

How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?
