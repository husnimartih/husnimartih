The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.
