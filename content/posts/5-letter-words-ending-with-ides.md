Inventions have helped make our lives easier, and have even had a huge impact on the world around us. We can thank inventions for some of the most significant moments in human history, such as the development of democracy and the automobile.

Section 3: The benefits of Diy.
Diy Ideas For The Busy Person
You're always busy and don't have time for anything. But what if we told you that there are benefits to Diy-ing? Yes, it's true! Here are three benefits of taking on a Do It Yourself project:

1. It can save you money. When you do things yourself, you don't have to pay someone else to do it for you. This means that you can put that money towards something else - like your savings or retirement account.

2. It can be therapeutic. Doing something with your hands can be very calming and satisfying. It can help take your mind off of your stressful day-to-day life and give you a sense of accomplishment when you finish a project.

3. It can be a bonding experience.

History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.
