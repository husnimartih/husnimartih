Invention as Art: The History of Invention and the Perceptions of the World
Invention is a process of coming up with new ideas or novel concepts that often change the world. It is an important part of society and economy, and has been used for centuries to create new products, services and ways of life. Invention has also been used to define different eras in history, such as the ancient Greeks who invented wine and cheese, the Romans who pioneered engineering and artillery, and the Americans who created radios, automobiles and other technological innovations.
There are a number of different perceptions of invention throughout history. Some people see invention as something that is automatically good, while others view it as something that can be done for profit or pleasure.

Patenting and registering an invention: What are the likely risks?
Patenting an invention is a process of officially registering a new product or service with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The benefits of patenting an invention include increased protection for your ideas, as well as easier access to potential customers and investors. However, there are a number of potential risks associated with patenting an invention. Here are three key points to consider when Patenting your Invention: 1) The USPTO can take years to review and grant a patent application, so it is important to be prepared for the wait. 2) There is a risk that your idea may not be accepted by the public or other decision-makers. 3) There is also a risk that your idea may not generate enough revenue to cover the costs associated with filing and prosecuting a patent application.

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?
