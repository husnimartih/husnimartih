What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

What are big ideas?
In recent weeks, we've heard a lot about big ideas. Ideas that could change the world, ideas that could make your company better, and ideas that could revolutionize how you do business. But what are big ideas? And how can they be used to improve your business? Here are some tips: 
-Think about the potential implications of your idea. What could it mean for customers, employees, or competitors? 
-Generate ways to test and measure the effectiveness of your idea. What would people say if they had access to this new product or service? How would you market and sell it? 
-Make sure you have a clear vision for your idea. What does your business need in order to achieve its goals? What does this new product or service offer that others don't? How will customers feel about using it?
