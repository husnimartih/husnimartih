Creative process: How does creative art come about?
Creative art comes about through a process termed as the creative process. The creative process begins with the creation of an idea or concept. Once the idea is created, it must be refined and developed into a realisation. The refining and development can take many forms, but in general, it involves exploring new ideas and concepts, working on a specific project, and ultimately producing a final product.

Idea 3: Give people the freedom to experiment.
A recent study by a team at the University of California, San Diego suggests that giving people the freedom to experiment may be key to solving some of society’s most pressing problems. The study, conducted with the help of a grant from the National Institutes of Health, surveyed more than 4,000 people in 20 different countries and found that those who had greater access to freedom were more likely to engage in creative forms of problem-solving. The researchers say their findings could lead to new ways to solve problems and spur innovation.

Considerations when renovating or upgrading: What should you take into account when renovating or upgrading your home?
Renovating or upgrading your home can be a great way to update and improve the look and feel of your home. However, there are some important considerations you should take into account when renovating or upgrading your home. Here are a few key points to keep in mind: 
1. Use common sense when renovating or upgrading your home – don’t overdo things and wait until it’s too late. You may not be able to afford to make any necessary changes later on, and you may not have the time or resources to do so. If you wait, you could end up regretting your decision. 
2. Don’t overspend – it’s always better to initially save up money rather than spend more on unnecessary features that won’t actually improve the look or function of your home.
