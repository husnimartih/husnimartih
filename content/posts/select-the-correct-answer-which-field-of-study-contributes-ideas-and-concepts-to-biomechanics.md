What are some tips for coming up with big ideas?
There are a few things that can help you come up with big ideas, but it takes time and effort. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Look at other people’s examples: When you’re brainstorming ideas, look at what others have done or are doing in the industry. This will give you a few starting points to work from.

2. Be open to feedback: Once you have a few ideas, it’s important to get feedback on them so that you can improve them. Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues; they might have some great ideas that haven’t been talked about yet.

3. Take risks: Sometimes the best ideas come from taking risks. Don’t be afraid to try something new or take chances on your projects.
