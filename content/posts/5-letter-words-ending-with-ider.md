1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.

When to consider a big idea: What are the benefits and drawbacks?
When to consider a big idea is an important question to answer because it can determine the success or failure of your project. There are many factors to consider when deciding when a big idea is the best time to pursue, such as the feasibility of the idea, the potential impact of your ideas, and who will be benefited by your project.

Summary: What are some things to remember when trying to be creative?
Creativity is a good thing, but it doesn't mean you have to be creative all the time. There are some things you can do to help make your creativity more effective. Here are some tips:
1. Try to find a subject that you feel passionate about. This will help get your creative juices flowing and give you ideas for projects that are specifically tailored to that subject matter.

2. experiment with different mediums and techniques. Don't be afraid to try new things, even if they don't work out immediately. You'll get better at creating with variety in mind.

3. make time for yourself each day. If you're not able to create during your normal hours, invest in time tomorrow that will allow you to be creative at night or during other times when you're free from distractions.
