Technology: How has technology changed the way we live and work?
Technology has changed the way we live and work. Today, there are more ways to connect with friends and family than ever before. With technology, we can do things that were once impossible. For example, I can now watch my favorite show when I’m at home without having to leave my couch. Technology has also allowed us to do things that were once impossible. For example, I can now work from home and get a high-paying job. Technology has also changed the way we think about work. Previously, work was seen as a necessary evil that was bad for our health and soul. However, with technology, work is no longer seen as necessary. Today, many people see work as an opportunity to learn new skills and grow their career.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.
