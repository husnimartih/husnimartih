Implementation: How do we make our ideas into a reality?
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any organization. It can help a company stay ahead of the competition and make new and innovative products. However, it can be difficult to implement new ideas. There are a number of ways to make innovation a reality in your organization. 
One way is to create a culture of innovation. This means that everyone in your organization is encouraged to come up with new ideas and try out new concepts. You also need to provide support for these ideas, whether that means granting credit for invention or providing resources to help them become reality. 

Another way to implementation innovation is through process improvement. By improving the way that you do things, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and/or implement new ideas. This can be done by changing processes or instituting standardized procedures.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

patenting inventions: What is the process of getting an invention patent?
There is the process of patenting inventions, which can be a long and difficult process. Patent applications must be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After an application is filed, the USPTO will review it and may ask for changes or modifications. If approved, the application will then be sent to a full-blown prosecution process. This can take several months or even years. Once the full-blown prosecution process is complete, an invention may be registered with the USPTO as a trademark, trade name, or other intellectual property.
