Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.

The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.

Big Ideas are the seeds of change that will grow into real solutions. They come out of necessity, not greed. It is important to remember that ideas can only become a reality if they are backed by a vision and a plan. To get started on turning big ideas into reality, it is helpful to have some idea what each step will entail and how you can measure the success of your project.
