The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.

Use of inventions in business: Why is this important?
invention ideas are important because they can help businesses save time and money. By using inventions, businesses can improve their products or services, slashed costs, and increased innovation. Here are three examples of how inventions have helped businesses: 
1. A key to a successful cosmetics company was the development of a new shade of lipstick that could be worn in all light colors. This led to the development of other popular shades, as well as new products such as lip balms and foundation kits. 
2. Another example is the development of a time-saving coffee maker that used drip coffee instead of pods. This led to lower costs for coffee and more efficient manufacturing processes.
3. The development of an air conditioning unit has allowed homes to be cooled much faster than previously possible. This has saved lives, particularly during summer heat waves.

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the life blood of any business. They provide a new idea or solution to a problem that can create new opportunities or generate new revenue. Big ideas are what drive innovation and creativity, and they can help companies grow and succeed. Here are four benefits of big ideas:
1. They inspire others to think differently about their own deeds and possibilities.

When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.

Big ideas promote teamwork by giving everyone a chance to contribute in a meaningful way.
