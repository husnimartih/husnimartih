The process of brainstorming: What is the best way to go about creating ideas?
brainstorming is a process that can be used in any activity, be it creative or scientific. By using brainstorming tools, you can generate ideas that may not have come to you through other methods. The following are some of the most popular and effective brainstorming tools:
1. The Grid: This tool helps you group known or potential solutions together according to their importance or similarity.

2. The Menu: This tool allows you to quickly list out different possibilities by listing a selection of options at the top and then scrolling down to see which ones are more relevant.

3. The Checklist: This tool allows you to list out possible solutions one by one, in order to make sure that each one is lined up perfectly with the others.
