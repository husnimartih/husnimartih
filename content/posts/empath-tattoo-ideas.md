Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.
