A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process. 

2. Take some time for yourself: Brainstorming is a great way to clear your head and come up with new ideas. However, don't work on your project for hours on end – set some limits and let the brainstorming process take its course.
