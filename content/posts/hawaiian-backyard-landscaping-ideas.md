2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.
