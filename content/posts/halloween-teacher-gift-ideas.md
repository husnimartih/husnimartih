Creative process: How does a creative artist go about creating work?
Creativity is an essential part of any creative artist’s process. The way a creative artist goes about creating work varies depending on the artist and their unique strengths and weaknesses. However, some basic steps that any creativeartist must take in order to create excellent work are as follows:
1. Determine what you want your work to be. This includes answering the question, “What does this piece of art represent for me?” After answering this question, you can begin to develop ideas for what your piece may look like or how it could be done.

2. Come up with a title and concept for your work. Once you have a title and concept, it is time to start developing the plot or story behind your work. This will involve coming up with characters and setting the scene for your story.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
