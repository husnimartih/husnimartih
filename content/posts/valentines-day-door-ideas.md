The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is anything but what it seems at first glance. The world is about to see a day where people can move around without needing a car, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, many experts say that the days of driving to work or school are numbered. Instead, people will be able to rely on ride-sharing, bikepacking, and other forms of transportation to get around.
