Invention is the process of creating a new product or idea. It can come from anything, such as a brainstorming session with friends, or an idea for a new product that you have been working on for months. The act of coming up with an invention is often filled with hard work and creativity, but it can also be fun and rewarding.

The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.
