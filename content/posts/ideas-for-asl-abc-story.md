Creative tools: What are they?
Creative tools, or tools that can help you be creative, are anything from a tool to help you brainstorm ideas to software that can help with creating art or designs. Here are 8 of the most common creative tools:
1. A spiral notebook – A spiral notebook is perfect for colorful and innovative ideas, as well as for taking sketches and ideas to paper. You’ll love using a spiral notebook as your creative tool because it makes it easy to jot down ideas and keep track of what you’ve been working on.
