Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

Prototype and Evaluation: How does one go about creating a prototype of an invention?
Prototype is a term that is often used in the industry to describe a preliminary version of an invention. It can also be used more generally to describe any form of product or service development. Prototype development typically begins with the identification of an idea or problem that needs to be solved before starting on the full development process. Once the problem has been identified, it is possible to explore potential solutions and prototypes can be created based on these solutions. After prototypes have been created, it is important to evaluate them for their feasibility and how they might be improved.
