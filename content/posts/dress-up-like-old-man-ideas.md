Ideas for inventions: What are some good ideas?
Invention ideas are always something to think about, especially when it comes to new technology or products. There are many different ways to come up with ideas for inventions, so there is no one right way. Here are some great ways to come up with new inventions: 
1. Developing a prototype – This can be done in many different ways, but often a Prototype will help you test the idea and see if it works. It can also help you determine how much money or time it will take to make the product real. 
2. Utilizing existing technology – If you have an existing product or technology that can be used in an invention, this is a great option. Not only will this give you a lot of ideas, but it can also save you time and money.
